## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach with the latest Next.js layout:

- **data-access/**: This folder contains all files interacting with the database. It includes Prisma models and database operations.
  
- **use-cases/**: This folder contains logic implementations for different functionalities. Business logic is separated from data access to ensure modularity.
  
- **emails/**: This folder contains templates for sending emails, such as reset password emails and magic link emails.
